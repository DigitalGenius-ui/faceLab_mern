## Description 
FaceLab is a social networking application created with React, Express, MongoDb, Node, and JWT. This social networking program allows users to create accounts, view other users' posts, upload his or her own content, like and comment on other users' posts, and follow or unfollow other users. Axios and react-query have been used to receive data from the backend. In addition to creating this application, I also used some other amazing libraries like React-icons, Material UI, and Sass was integrated into the design.
